# AI_FinalTermProject_9*9Soduku_using_Backtracking
Goal is to build an agent to play a 9 * 9 Sudoku Game using Backtracking Algorithm
# overview of 9 * 9 Sudoku game
Sudoku, also known as Su Doku, popular form of number game. In its simplest and most common configuration, sudoku consists of a 9 × 9 grid with numbers appearing in some of the squares. The object of the puzzle is to fill the remaining squares, using all the numbers 1–9 exactly once in each row, column, and the nine 3 × 3 subgrids. 
Sudoku is based entirely on logic, without any arithmetic involved, and the level of difficulty is determined by the quantity and positions of the original numbers. 
# Backtracking Algorithm
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
# Instructions to run the project
To Play this Game you just need to follow 2 techniques
- Check each number 1 through 9.
- Check for one missing number in each Row, Column, and Quadrant.
You just need to place the numbers 1 through 9 in each Quadrant, Row, and Column without any number being repeated.
